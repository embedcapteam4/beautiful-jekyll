We decided to go with the Smart Mirror for our capstone project. This mirror looks like a mostly ordinary mirror, but has an LCD screen behind it that can display useful information to the user. Since the Smart Mirror is a display itself, there are numerous possibilities to the kind of applications we could develop for it. Our focus is going to be on a computer vision element, as well as an integrated smart phone application.

### Facial Recognition
To make the mirror even 'smarter', we are going to incorporate a computer vision element into the design. By using a camera for facial recognition we can identify the specific person standing in front of the mirror and load their own custom profile for the mirror.

Currently we are looking into the OpenCV framework to help us obtain accurate facial recognition. OpenCV is an Open Source Computer Vision library that is well supported and documented.

### Mobile application
