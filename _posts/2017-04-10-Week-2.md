We decided to go with the Smart Mirror for our capstone project. This mirror looks like a mostly ordinary mirror, but has an LCD screen behind it that can display useful information to the user. Since the Smart Mirror is a display itself, there are all kinds of applications we could develop for it. Our focus is going to be on a computer vision element, as well as an integrated smart phone application.

### Facial Recognition
To make the mirror even 'smarter', we are going to incorporate a computer vision element into the design. By using a camera for facial recognition we can identify the specific person standing in front of the mirror and load their own custom profile.

Currently we are looking into the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) framework to help us obtain accurate facial recognition. [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is an Open Source Computer Vision library that is well supported and documented, which makes it perfect for our needs. Soon we are meeting with a referral to get some advice on this computer vision component of our design. Hopefully we can get some advice on a camera to get so we can order that as soon as possible.

### Mobile application
The mirror itself is not a touchscreen, so we need to incorporate a better way to control it. We hope to solve this issue by developing a smart phone app that can customize the mirror settings. It was suggested to look into using a web app for our platform rather then developing for iOS, so that is our intended direction right now.
