### Facial Recognition: (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)

### Mobile Application: Updates (Brandon)
TODO

### Gesture Control (Ryan, Kurtis)
We have just recieved the gesture sensor at [Hover](http://www.hoverlabs.co/products/hover/), (shown below). Potential uses for the gesture sensor include: swiping to additional modules, choosing to create a new profile, and configuring user profiles through a drag-and-drop like mechanism.

### Smart Mirror ON/OFF Protocol (Brad)
With the base proximity sensor module, we found that when the HDMI output was turned OFF, the monitor displayed an ugly textbox saying that no signal was detected. To work around this problem, our group tried out a few options.

Potential Solutions:
* Loading an HTML-defined black rectangle to cover everything on the screen
* Turning off HDMI output with /bin/vcgencmd
* Turning off HDMI output with /bin/tvservice
* Setting the brightness through 0/255

At the end, we decided that the first option (HTML cover) was the best and easiest option to implement. However, after discovering CEC, we will also consider turning off the power of the monitor directly with the proximity sensor.

## Next Steps:

### Facial Recognition: (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)
Facial recognition seems to be fully functional on the MagicMirror. After realizing that the "negative" images were not being read correctly, the facial detection algorithm seemed to be correctly identifying strangers. Going forward, we are planning to tweak our positive threshold further to ensure that facial recognition works accurately during the Mother of All Demos (MOAD).

### Mobile Application: (Brandon)
TODO

### Gesture Control: (Ryan, Kurtis)
With the Hover hardware in our hands, development for user input through gestures can finally start. We hope to get gesture sensing fully implemented within our system by the end of next week.

### Smart Mirror ON/OFF Protocol (Brad)
The Proximity Sensor appears to be fully functional and is implemented in the mirror. Further tweaking will need to be done so that the mirror turns on and off appropriately. Also, we will need to implement a way for the proximity sensor module to run while the mirror is in the idle state. We plan to use CEC protocol to toggle the monitor ON/OFF through HDMI.
