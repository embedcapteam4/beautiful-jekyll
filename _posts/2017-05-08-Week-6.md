### Gesture Control (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)
The Hover gesture sensor has finally arrived (Monday) and development has already started for when we get the sensor in our hands. The JS, Python, Node.JS, and package.json files were coded up with reference from other modules that we have. Assuming these portions do not have any bugs, the only aspect that gesture control will need to be functional is the code for what we want the gesture sensor to do for each gesture. This will be located in the modules that we want the gesture signals to be sent to in their notificationReceived functions.

### Gesture Control: (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)
Our group still needs to decided and finalize what we want to do with gestures from the gesture sensor. From there, we will need to handle the signals that our built Hover module sends out.

### Smart Mirror ON/OFF Protocol (Brad)
Our group still needs to tweak the protocol so that the mirror turns on and off for appropriate distances and time. Also, we will need to implement a way for the proximity sensor module to run while the mirror is in the idle state. We plan to use CEC protocol to toggle the monitor ON/OFF through HDMI.

### Smart Mirror Frame (Ryan, Kurtis, Brandon, Brad)
We will delay finalizing the frame until the rest of the mirror software is completed (Week 9/10).
