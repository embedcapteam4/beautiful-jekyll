### Facial Recognition: (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)

### Mobile Application: Updates (Brandon)
TO DO

### Gesture Control (Ryan, Kurtis)
We ordered the gesture sensor at [Hover](http://www.hoverlabs.co/products/hover/), (shown below).

### Smart Mirror ON/OFF Protocol (Brad)
Initially, we were planning to use our camera to continuosly run in order to detect motion to determine whether the MagicMirror should be on. However, after some more thought, we realized that there may be a problem in the mirror running multiple modules concurrently. We'd have to figure out how to run both the facial detection module and the proximity-sensor like module at the same time to let the mirror know when it should turn off. Instead of worrying about the cross-functionality between two modules, we decided that it'd be simpler to use a seperate piece of hardware to handle the ON/OFF functionality. We found a module online and implemented it into our mirror.

### Mobile Application: (Brandon)

### Gesture Control: (Ryan, Kurtis)
Currently, we are brainstorming functionality for the gestures that we can use to interface with our MagicMirror. On idea that we had was to use it to drag-and-drop to customize each user's profile. We will probably discover user inputs that we will need in the future as we continue to develop our mirror.

### Smart Mirror ON/OFF Protocol (Brad)
The way that the module turns "off" our mirror makes our monitor display an ugly image stating that there is no signal from the HDMI. We are planning to change the brightness of the screen in order to simulate the ON/OFF functionality in order to alleviate this problem. We are also hoping to get this proximity sensor module fully integrated into the MagicMirror.
