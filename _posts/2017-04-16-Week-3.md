## Development

### Facial Recognition: Status (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)
We received our [camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00VFQK1Q6/ref=ya_st_dp_summary) and were able to begin with the facial recognition implementation. First we installed the our dependencies onto the Raspberry Pi 3.
Here are the dependencies needed:
* [python-shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-shell) - Needed to run Python scripts from Node.js. Our Smart Mirror OS uses Node.js so we use it here to run our OpenCV Python based scripts.
{% highlight bash %}
npm install
{% endhighlight %}
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) - The computer vision library we will use for face recognition.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv
{% endhighlight %}

OpenCV has three main algorithms for face recognition.
* Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)
* Eigenfaces
* Fisherfaces

Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces view the entire dataset to find a recognized face, while LBPH compares individual sets with each other until a match is found. Since LBPH compares individually, we hypothesized that this would be the fastest algorithm for our purposes.

To recognize a face using these methods, you first must provide a set of images that can be analyzed to create a training set. We took about 20 pictures of Ryan's face and then used those images for creating our training set. With the training set compiled, we then ran a test to compare the video stream from the camera to the saved data set. On our first test, we were able to get a strong match!!!

(INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE)

Next we added Brad's profile to the data set. Here is where we ran into trouble. The method did not match Brad with his profile, but instead kept matching with Ryan's profile. We tried using different algorithms with varying thresholds, and still had the same issue. Currently we are investigation why this may be the cause, but our suspicions lie with the camera used. Our camera is a 1 Megapixel camera. We chose a this camera with a lower resolution because we worried that the Raspberry Pi would not be able to process images of high resolution fast enough. We think that this resolution may actually be too low to differentiate faces from one another, especially with someone standing a feet or two away from the camera lens.

### Facial Recognition: Next week (Ryan, Kurtis, Brad)

We ordered the [Pi Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) which has a much higher resolution of 8 Megapixels. It also supports 1080p video at 30fps or 720p at 60fps. With these specifications our results should be much better, and we can actually adjust the resolution of the images taken so it will help us isolate this issue.

This next week we want to get recognition working properly. With the new camera we will try the same tests and see if the results are better. This camera has the ability to adjust resolution so with some testing we should be able to come up with an optimal resolution that has good performance, as well as reliable recognition. Once this is setup correctly we can begin with the custom user profile options for our Smart Mirror.
