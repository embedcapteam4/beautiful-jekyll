### Idea #1: Smart Mirror
Our idea is to create a smart mirror, capable of displaying useful information to the user. We want to incorporate a computer vision element into the software, enabling the mirror to be customizable per user based on a facial recognition profile.

Another cool feature would be to create a smart phone app that can be used to interact with the mirror. A user could upload their preferred mirror layout, or even have their own to-do list sync up with the mirror display.

	<img style="width: 50%; height: 50%" src="{{ '/img/smartmirror.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">

</figure>

### Idea #2: Real-time translator
Create a translator device that is capable of listening to speech in one language, and translating it to another language to playback in the user's ear. This would be a more hardware oriented project than our first idea.
