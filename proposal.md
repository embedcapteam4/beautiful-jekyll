### Problem Space
Most people spend time in front of a mirror each day. It is a convenient time and place to absorb information and plan your day. Most of this information is obtained from your phone. However, your hands will be most likey be occupied if you're standing in front of a mirror getting ready. Having to constantly pause your routine to look down at your phone for the news, weather, and intinerary slow you down.   

### Examples
Scenario 1: Imagine you're getting ready to head to go to the airport 
Scenario 2: Imagine you're getting ready for an interview and need to tie your tie. You pull out your phone and look up a tutorial on Youtube. You constantly exchange looks between your mirror and phone as you attempt to prepare your tie for your important interview.
