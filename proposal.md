### Problem Space
Most people spend time in front of a mirror each day. It is a convenient time and place to absorb information and plan your day. Most of this information is obtained from your phone. However, your hands will be most likey be occupied if you're standing in front of a mirror getting ready. Having to constantly pause your routine to look down at your phone for the news, weather, and intinerary can slow you down.   

### Examples
* Scenario 1: You're getting ready and waxing your hair. You have a list full of errands to run for the day, and try to go to the notes in your phone. However, with both your hands coverd in wax, you have no choice but to wait until after you're done to begin reviewing the long list of tasks you have set out for the day. 

* Scenario 2: You have an interview coming up and need to tie your tie. You pull out your phone and look up a tutorial on Youtube. You constantly exchange looks between your mirror and phone as you attempt to prepare your tie for your important interview. As you struggle to get ready, the clock continues to tick.

There are several existing Smart Mirrors already. However, their functionality does not include features that we hope to implement in our design such as facial recognition that will match with an existing profile set up beforehand.

### Potential Solutions
Develop a Smart Mirror with features that eliminate these inconveniences. Instead of having to juggle between handling your mobile device and getting ready, the information is available right on your mirror. Features will include:
* Motion Gesture controlled 
* Facial Recognition
* Proximity Sensor that controls On/Off state
* Camera that detects face, takes picture, and compares to previously saved photo
* Sync notes/reminders from phone or have profile match bring up notes/reminders
* Dual display between phone and mirror 
* Display basic information:
  * Time and Date
  * Weather
  * Bus Schedule (OneBusAway API)
  * Maybe pull up TV channels (news, shows, etc)

### Resource Budget
* Hover motion gesture: $29 + $5 shipping
* Acrylic Screen: ~$15
* 2 Way Mirror Film: $26.76
* Frame: ~$20
* Camera: $22.44
* Approximate Total: $118.20
