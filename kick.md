###About this project
__Our MagicMirror is a product that will revolutionize your morning routine.__
Most people spend time in front of a mirror each day. It is a convenient time and place to absorb information and plan your day. Most of this information is obtained from your phone. However, your hands will be most likely be occupied if youâ€™re standing in front of a mirror getting ready. Having to constantly pause your routine to look down at your phone for the news, weather, and intinerary can slow you down. 

__With our MagicMirror you'll be ready to kickstart your busy day every morning!__

Facial Recognition: The photos above show our facial recognition algorithm correctly identifying the user in front of the camera (Brandon). For our magic mirror, users will be able to load customized profiles that will be matched to each user's face. Thus, every user will be able to tune their MagicMirror experience however they would like.

Gesture Sensing: To take in user input, our mirror will implement a gesture sensor that a user can use to interact with the system. Example uses include customizing profiles and switching MagicMirror pages.

Web App: In order to handle different user profiles, we will implement a web app that should be accessible on all phones. With this app, users will be able to create and customize their user profiles to their liking.

Mirror Housing: The monitor will be enclosed behind a two-way mirror so that a user will be able to view their reflection while viewing the information displayed on the MagicMirror. The housing will be made out of high-quality wood to ensure that the mirror is aesthetically pleasing.
